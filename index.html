		<h3>Welllingtons Internet</h3>

		<p>I have gone around Welligton and taken images of objects that make up our seemingly hidden internet system. The following objects help in making one of the most used pieces of tech that we have to date.</p>

			<h1>CCTV Camera Systems</h1>
			<p>CCTV cameras are the eyes of the streets. Where ever you go in the city, these cameras are made to watch every move you make.</p>

				<h3>Car Park Overwatch</h3>
				<p>A fixed CCTV camera watches over a car park. These are protection against car damage and or car theft. They are found in most inner city car parks. Judging by the mounting system, this camera is on a fixed angle aiming toward the park entry, watching everyone that goes in and out throughout the entire day.</p>

				<h3>Traffic Control</h3>
				<p>This light bulb looking CCTV cam is arched over the footpath toward the road. A lot of these types of camera are for traffic and road surveillance. Some of these cameras can be remote accessed over the internet by anyone of the public, giving people an idea of road traffic without the need to leave their homes.</p>

				<h3>Building protection</h3>
				<p>This camera was outside of a museum, specifically made for protecting the building and the contents inside. This building was facing the foot path, watching every that walks by. They are made to catch suspicious activity and prevent break ins and burglaries </p>

				<h3>Eyes in the sky</h3>
				<p>This camera has a similar look to that of example two, except this camera is way up atop of a tall building looking downward. This camera is watching the road and footpath and because it is so high up, it is hard to spot in its descrete location.</p>

			<h1>Antennas</h1>
			<p>Antennas and aerials are essential to radio equipment. Antennas can be designed to transmit and receive radio waves in all horizontal directions - Wikipedia.org</p>

				<h3>Shapes and sizes</h3>
				<p>This commercial building has Antennae and Aerials of all shapes and sizes. Likely this building contains many different offices and companies, each needing their own seperate Antenna for connections.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/ant/ant2.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>House and Home</h3>
				<p>This is a basic house Antenna that typically most homes will have attached to their roof. These provide their radio connections for services such as television coverage. The Antenna will pickup the radio signal and send it stright to your TV.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/ant/ant3.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Roof tops</h3>
				<p>These two Antennae likely have the exact same use as the previous one in image two. Roof tops are the best placement for these as they are unobstructed and can pickup on signals without disturbance.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">

			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Downscale</h3>
				<p>This is a very small Antenna on top of a business building. There is only one main pole so we can assume that it is a single business using this building, working off of just one single Aerial.</p>

			<h1>Underground Covers</h1>
			<p>These ground covers provide us with easy access for maintenace into the hidden underground world of cables and wires, providing us internet.</p>
		</section>
	</header>

	<section>
		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/cvr/cover1.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Double Trouble</h3>
				<p>Two manhole covers side by side. The size of these holes allow maintenance workers ease of access into the underground. The point of the covers is the exact opposite to that of the hole itself, the cover stop people from falling in.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/cvr/cover2.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Hook Holes</h3>
				<p>Another cover, very similar to the first image and likely with the exact same purpose. This one has double holes on each side so the maintenance teams can hook under them and remove them easily</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/cvr/cover3.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>For Longer</h3>
				<p>Another manhole cover, however this one has a few differences. This one is not made out of pure metals, more of a plasticy feel to it. It is also longer than the other manholes, likely because underneath is a different type of object with a different purpose.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/cvr/cover4.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Patterned</h3>
				<p>This manhole has different patterns on it, possibly signifying a different use and or purpose. However it is still and access point to the underground.</p>
